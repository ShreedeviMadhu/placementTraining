Java Type Casting:
Type casting is when you assign a value of one primitive data type to another type.

In Java, there are two types of casting:
Implicit: internally/compiler
Widening Casting (Automatically) - Converting a smaller type to a larger type size
byte -> short -> char -> int -> long -> float -> double
Explicit: externally/developer
Narrowing Casting (Manually) - Converting a larger type to a smaller size type
double -> float -> long -> int -> char -> short -> byte


Widening Casting:

Widening casting is done automatically when passing a smaller size type to a larger
size type:

Narrowing Casting:

Narrowing casting must be done manually by placing the type in parentheses in front
of the value:
